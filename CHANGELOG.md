# Changelog

## 0.8.0

Initial Apache-2.0 release of the Attesto-native dual-era MCP server.

- Require released `attesto_mcp ~> 1.2` and use its public prepared resource
  protection contract without sibling-path or older-auth fallbacks.
- Preserve unknown JSON-RPC extensions and add precise recursive message types.
- Isolate same-session legacy streams, prefer the newest live stream for
  server-originated client requests, wait briefly for an owned stream during
  connection startup, and make stale teardown ownership-safe.
- Make cancellation, detached-owner cleanup, nil-ID work, correlation, and
  request terminal telemetry exact-once under races.
- Add frozen official conformance evidence and exact TypeScript 2.0.0 and
  Python 2.1.1 client smoke gates for both supported eras.
