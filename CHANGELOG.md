# Changelog

## 0.9.0 - 2026-08-26

- Accept and exactly echo MCP `2025-06-18` during legacy initialization while
  retaining `2025-11-25` and preferred `2026-07-28` behavior.
- Preserve the negotiated legacy revision in HTTP session state and enforce it
  on later protocol-version headers.
- Add stdio initialize/list/call coverage and authenticated HTTP lifecycle
  regression coverage for `2025-06-18`.
- Isolate the live stdio regression's installation cache so stale build state
  cannot contaminate protocol stdout startup.
- Use the negotiated session revision when a legacy HTTP client omits the
  protocol-version header, while rejecting invalid or changed header values.
- Gate catalog/content icons, explicit elicitation modes, and sampling tool
  selection to revisions that define those fields.
- Reject an initialize protocol-version header when its revision was disabled
  by the host's `protocol_versions` configuration.
- Expose the exact negotiated legacy revision as `context.protocol_version` to
  request handlers.

## 0.8.0

Initial Apache-2.0 release of the Attesto-native dual-era MCP server.

- Require released `attesto_mcp ~> 1.2` and use its public prepared resource
  protection contract without sibling-path or older-auth fallbacks.
- Preserve unknown JSON-RPC extensions and add precise recursive message types.
- Isolate same-session legacy streams, prefer the newest live stream for
  server-originated client requests, wait briefly for an owned stream during
  connection startup, and make stale teardown ownership-safe.
- Make cancellation, detached-owner cleanup, nil-ID work, correlation, and
  request terminal telemetry exact-once under races.
- Add frozen official conformance evidence and exact TypeScript 2.0.0 and
  Python 2.1.1 client smoke gates for both supported eras.
